<string name="about_us_content">Cashman Physiotherapy was founded 20 years ago on The Terrace by Rob Cashman specialising in Sports and Spinal therapy.   &lt;br/>  &lt;br/>
As well as Rob Cashman we have three other very experience staff, Loralee Reid, Alistair Fergus and Liam MacLachlan, who between them can cater for any type of injury you may have; we have large, private treatment rooms and the best selection of magazines in town though as we endeavour to see our clients at their appointment time, the chances of you being able to read them are somewhat slim.
 &lt;br/> &lt;br/>	
Half an hour is allocated for an initial assessment and generally 15 minute for any further appointments and our clinic is open Monday to Friday from 7.30 through to 5 pm.  &lt;br/>&lt;br/>
For pricing please refer to our website www.cashmanphysio.co.nz
